Tools and techniques for using medical imaging software to visualize astronomy data

More information on the Astronomical Medicine project can be found [here](http://am.iic.harvard.edu/).

Unfortunately, the project is largely defunct at the moment, and you may have a very hard time compiling this code due to its
dependence on third-party libraries that have changed significantly since this code was originally developed.

I (Douglas Alan, doug AT alum.mit.edu) have two pre-built binaries, which you can get by contacting me. One of them will only run on rather
old versions of OS X. The other one is for Linux, but I do not know whether it will run properly on recent versions of Linux.

**NOTE:** The software developed specifically for Astronomical Medicine is distributed with the permissive MIT license,
but we use some third-party libraries that carry GPL licenses. Due to the viral nature of GPL, this means that any
executable generated from this code is bound by the terms of the GPL.
