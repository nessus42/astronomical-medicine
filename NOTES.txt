These are the options that should be supported in the next version:

XXX The DLL:

   XXX This should just load the data cube and do nothing related to WCS with
   it.  I.e., it should be just like --no-wcs.

{default}

   Does what "--reorient-north --equiangular" does now.  The axes are in
   microdegrees.  The pixel values should also be scaled by 1000 (for
   floating point images, but not for integer images), and the
   velocity axis should be auto-scaled.

   Should output some of what is currently output for the verbose
   option should be output:

      New format:

      Image center, in pixels: (86, 41.5, 314.5)

      Pixel size in km/s:



       NOTE: Put the comments in the help text, rather than here.
       Also for velocity, may have to instead do something like:

       Pixel size in velocity: $#@$@$#@
       Velocity units: km/s


--quiet, -q

  Suppress the above mentioned above.

XXX -h

   Outputs the terse usage message.

XXX -n

   Don't actually do anything.

XXX --help
   Outputs the verbose usage message.

--no-wcs, --nw
   Leaves the image alone.

   --north-up
     Rotates the image so that north is up.  Only works in conjunction
     with --no-wcs.

   --west-right
     Rotates the image so thata west is to the right.  Only works in
     conjunction with --no-wcs.

--force-ra-dec, --frd
   Forces the axes to be RA and Dec, rather than angular degrees.

--west-axis-scale NUM, --was NUM
  Sets the x-axis scale to be NUM microdegrees.  The default value is 1.
  TODO: Figure out what this should do if --no-wcs is set.

--north-axis-scale NUM, --nas NUM
  Sets the y-axis scale to be NUM microdegrees.  The default value is 1.
  TODO: Figure out what this should do if --no-wcs is set.

--v-axis-scale NUM, --vas NUM
  TODO: Figure out what this should do.

--scale-all-axes {x}, --saa NUM, -a NUM
  TODO: Figure out precisely what this should do.

--null-value NUM, -N NUM
  Sets the null value.  The default value is NaN.  (TODO: Find out
  what it is for integer FITS types.)  You can't set this to 0, due to
  a limitation in CFITSIO.  (TODO: Post to fitsbits or something to
  see if this is really true.)

--debug-level INT, -D INT
  Sets the debug level to INT.  The default value is 0.

--pixel-scale {x}, --ps
  Every pixel will be multiplied by x upon converting from FITS to ITK.  The
  default value is 1000.

--flip-west, --fw
--flip-north, --fn
--flip-v, --fv

--rotate-sky {x}, --rs
  Rotates the image by x degrees counter-clockwise.

--verbose

--show-fits-header

--derivative-image-filter
--flip-image-filter
--binomial-blur-filter
--suppress-metadata-dictionary
--identity-flip

--coerce-to-shorts, --cts
--coerce-to-unsigned-shorts, --ctus

--lps
  For use with programs other than Slicer that do not need the kludge
  that compensates for Slicer's conversion to RAS.


OPTIONS TO REMOVE
=================


--RIP

  Replace this with noticing that the output file format is ".hdr" or
  ".dat" and set the option automatically.

-A

  This does velocity autoscaling, but should be set by default.

--auto-scale-v-axis, --asva, -A
  Auto-scales the velocity axis.  It does this by making it the same size as
  the larger of the west and north axes.

  TODO: I think this is going to be the default, and there should be
  another option to not do this.


OTHER THINGS TO CONSIDER
========================

o BUNITS is the FITS header that describes the units for the intensity
  scale.  We may want to output it, if it is present, but it doesn't
  occur in all FITS files.

o Here is an exemplar of the velocity information for a data cube.  This
  one is just a bunch of slices with a linear delta between slices:

     CRVAL3  =       -9970.58488358 /
     CRPIX3  =              1.00000 /
     CDELT3  =        63.5021900000 /
     CTYPE3  = 'VELO-LSR'           /

  VELO-LSR here means Local Standard Region, which means that the
  doppler shifts have been adjusted to the average velocity of a
  canonical area of the galaxy around our sun.  Notice, however, that
  there are no units.  Jens says that there is a standard default
  units.  I should look this up in the FITS standards document to see
  what it has to say on the issue.
